# TP generator  
This is a code that simply can read the waveforms from a textfile and generate the Trigger Primitives.

For the moment, it is just a notebook ready to run. 
Bear in mind that the TP format can be changed. 

Here there are some low energy electron events.
To do something more, the geometry and channel mapping are needed (on the way).
